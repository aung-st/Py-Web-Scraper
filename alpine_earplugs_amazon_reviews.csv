0,K.Red,"I use these because I have tinnitus and I wanted to protect my ears from further damage without totally blocking out noise. the three levels of filtration means I can switch between them depending on the levels of noise I'm exposing my ears to, if I'm going to a party I would use a lower level filter, and use a higher one if going to a concert or festival. The product is of excellent quality and I feel that it will last me years if I take care of it."
1,Aljona,"I lost somewhere my other plugs, so decided to research and buy new ones. These were supposed to be best ones available. Even though they are quite pricey I decided to get them, since health is more important. How much I regret it now...First of all, they hurt my ears, which creates extra headache. I do not put them deep into my ears, just to the point where they create vacuum. Second one, they create noise in ears, like as if you were listening to sea shell. And this is definitely not what I want! Third one, quality of noise filtering is low! It does not reduce noise enough and quality of sound gets a bit distorted, adding some kind of a pitch to it.As a result I was left completely disappointed with my purchase. If I could I would definitely send them back, but since I already tried them out I can't do that. My mood got completely ruined for today, because now at these hard times I literally used my last money to get something that I expected to improve quality of my life, but instead I got a completely rubbish product that does not live up to amount I paid for it. If you buy £6 plugs or these plugs, it won't make a difference. So don't waste your money on it!"
2,Matty,"Didn't really know what to expect from these as I've used hearing protection before and never really got on with them.However, these fit nicely in my ear without feeling like I need to ""seal"" them in, they just sit in the ear canal and feel extremely comfortable which is something I've not experienced before with hearing protection!As a vocalist, they take some time to get used to as even the smallest reduction in volume requires a bit of adaptation as you expect to hear sharp, precise sound but of course there's a degree of volume reduction and tone.However, after a few songs in rehearsal the other day I felt comfortable enough to leave them in and do a whole set without taking them out which is very rare for me. They work extremely well and that day we were LOUD, yet, I walked out without any feeling of temporary deafness.These are definitely the best type of hearing protection I've used, in terms of fitment, presentation (You get a great little case, a spare earbud etc) and price point."
3,Bobet the nobet,"These are my 3rd pair, the only criticism is they are easy to loose. Hardly seems fair to down rate them for my stupidity! They do only come in one size/ shape. So if you have tiny ear canals, they may not be comfortable. But the feel great in my ears. As for sound proofing, I'm a drummer and play pretty loudly. Using these I've managed to stop that horrible screech you get on an evening after a gig. Without the use of a monitor, I've also found I can pick up most of the bass, so I can still follow the band properly. Great for going to gigs too."
4,Konosh,"I delayed my reviewing of this product as I wanted to see how they worked over a prolonged period. In short, these are brilliant.I’m a musician who plays in pub bands and it was starting to be a bit loud for me on stage. So I looked into all types of hearing protection and these were recommended by other musicians. These are very good and have different filters if it gets louder that you can change out. What I also love about these is there is a string so these can hang around your neck during a gig and if it gets too loud, you can pop one or both in. What I liked about these is you can sing in tune with these and still hear everybody else in the band clearly. Just at a lower volume."
5,A R Palmer,"I have a full drum kit along with guitars and amps in a fairly small wooden cabin. The drums in particular are very loud, with the snare (even if damped) being painfully “explosive “ on the ears! These plugs are very effective indeed, being easy to set up and a comfortable fit. I soon forget they were in and did not notice any deterioration or obvious muting of the sound - either produced by the drums/ guitar or a powerful sound system. I would highly recommend a set to any musician/ DJ/ concert goer."
6,Graeme,"I play in bands, I go and watch bands, I'm heavily involved with the live music scene, I always wear hearing protectors, I've had quite a few over the years, some break, some get lost etc, in all honesty these are the equal to the really expensive ones I've had in the past but at a fraction of the cost, they are easy to use with the three different volume level adjusters, colour coordinated so you can easily pick what you need for that venue, I highly recommend these noise reduction ear plugs, great fitting and unbelievabe effectiveness without blocking the important frequencies, they overall reduce the actual volume level smoothly and efficiently."
7,Joe,"I haven't been to see any live music since developing tinnitus, and was worried about doing so even after buying these. I needn't have worried, they are brilliant.The only downside is getting only 3 earplugs, give people 4.I have only used them twice, but so far I'm very impressed."
